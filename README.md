# Project Setup with Docker, PostgreSQL, and Node.js

This guide outlines the steps to set up a project using Docker, PostgreSQL, Prisma for migrations, and a Node.js service. Follow these instructions to get your project up and running.

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have Docker installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can download and install it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

2. Alternatively, if you have PostgreSQL already installed locally, you can adjust the environment variables and use the schema provided in the repository.

## Getting Started

### 1. Docker Compose Configuration

- Open the `docker-compose.yaml` file and adjust it according to your preferences. This file defines the services and configurations for your PostgreSQL container.

### 2. Compose the Docker Image

- Use the following command to compose the Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

### 3. Verify Docker Container

- Confirm that the PostgreSQL container is running by checking its status with:

    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

### 4. Environment Variables

- Modify the `.env` file in the `docker-compose.yaml` to match your desired environment configurations.

### 5. Install Node.js Dependencies

- Run the following command to install the Node.js project dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### 6. Database Migration (Choose one method)

#### Option 1: Using Prisma

- If you prefer using Prisma for migrations, run the following command to create an initial migration:

    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init
    ```

#### Option 2: Using .sql provided

- Alternatively, you can use the provided `.sql` file for database setup if you prefer not to use Prisma for migrations. Import the `.sql` file into your PostgreSQL database.

### 7. Run the Node.js Service

- Start the Node.js service by running:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### 8. Testing with Postman

- A Postman collection is available for testing the API. You can import it into Postman to try out the endpoints.

You have successfully set up your project with Docker, PostgreSQL, Prisma (optional), and a Node.js service. Feel free to customize the project further according to your requirements.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
